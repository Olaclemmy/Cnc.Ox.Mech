## Overview

This is a 3D Cad Solidworks model of the Ox CNC from Ooznest with the modified plates

Most of the design is held together via M5 nuts, but some of the brackets are using drop in M4 T Nuts
just because this is what i had spare at the time

## TODO

### Motor cover

  * https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1002246/files

### Z Axis End stop

I need to merge in a design between the Z Axis End stop and the cable chain



### Parts

For the motor mount, typically the brackets for 2.2Kw motors are about 12mm thick, which is the same as the mdf I'm using
so I should be able to fasten on brackets for Max Z Height on the same plane as the spindle, and other tools besides

  * The bolt spacing is 60mm for connecting parts to the spolier board
    add to spoiler board design
  * hole diameter is 7mm for the spoiler board because of the fasteners underneath
    and 6mm for the stock as that is the size of the bolts

  * Design brackets for the dremmel to raise it up more

### Cable Chain

Need to play this one by ear, I Think the cable chain may have problems bending at the angle I need maybe

  * Check the pilot hole sizes for the self tappers used in the cablechain brackets on the Y and X Axis
  * Finish the 2nd part of the cablechain bracket (the one that fastens to the moving Y Axis gantry)
  * cable chain outer diameter is 110mm approx
