## Overview

This is a set of G-Code files for use with TinyG / Chillipepr.
Since I'm using a dremmel at the time of writing the feed rate is set to be very slow

For the first set of G-Codes this assumes a mill bit of 3.7mm / 12mm mdf

  * 1 - Rough milling out of the center hole for the inductive sensor
  * 2 - Final pass for the center hole
  * 3 - Outer edge / cut

The second set of G-Codes is for the part placed on it's side with a small drill bit for the pilot holes, and a 3.7mm mill bit for the recess

  * 4 - drill paths - 20mm apart
  * 5 - recess for the screw heads to sit in
