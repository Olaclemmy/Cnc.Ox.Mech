## SolidBase

I need to get some M5 / M8 threaded inserts, then work out how large the clearance hole needs to be
for the top and the bottom

  * check size of clearance hole
  * check depth of hole needed
  * so far assuming 7mm hole, and 13mm depth of hole

Also I need to look into raising the height 

There will be 3 different configurations this can be used with

  * First we can drop a nut or bolt into the slot to attach small items
  * Next we can create a slotted adapter for things such as the Alid Router or a 3d printer head etc
  * Next we can run M8 bolts directly into the plate without slotting for the 2.2Kw heavy router and just use it as a straight adapter plate

## 2.2kw mount

check on the length of M8 bolts available


## Workzone spindle

  * finish making new spindle using old mount method
  * design mount for new mount method and build
