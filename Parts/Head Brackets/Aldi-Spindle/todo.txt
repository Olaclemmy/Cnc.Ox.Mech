
Create a version 2 using version 1
one of the bits has split anyway so we could do with a new setup, use v2 seperate directory

1. the holes are slightly undersized because of the mill not the model
Expand the 8mm hols to 8.5mm for additional clearance

2. move the 6mm hole further out so we can drill it without obstruction

4. add a bracket / support for the proximity sensor underneath
outer edge of the support should be 30mm away from the surface of the bottom bracket

5. change drill holes to 3mm

6. we need drill holes into the part we're attaching to

7. remove one of the stick up supports (cylinder)
so that there's only one on the right hand side

8. bring the router further forward a bit so we can access the fixing screws using an allan key

9. add note about creating a zero point before starting in case a reset is needed
y - 5mm is one way to create a reference point

9. experiment with the new router using a 6mm bit / 3mm bit at 500min/min

10. making the large circle the router fits into slightly larger is an option
this might be due to undersizing of the original dremmel bit so I need to measure up first

11. The back plate could do with being longer to allow removal of the router without taking off the back support
12. also the back plate needs a bit trimming from the back to alow the mount to go higher if needed

13. recommend those t nuts with spring loaded balls in

12. the spindle extends 50mm from the bracket base bottom
6mm bit extends 35mm beyond that
i found its best to lower the z axis to its lowest point, then set the bottom of the bracket 50mm above that
